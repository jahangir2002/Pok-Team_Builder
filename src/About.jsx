          Hi there, I'm Jahangir, a front-end developer with a passion for creating interactive applications.  I gained experience with state management, component design, and API integration through this project.  I mainly use React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, but I also enjoy experimenting with animation libraries like Framer Motion and Lenis to make interfaces come to life.  I like creating simple, responsive layouts that feel easy to use and enjoyable, incorporating playful user interface elements like dynamic icons and glassmorphism.  Managing state across components and creating a theme-aware interface that feels like it belongs in the Pok√©mon universe were just two examples of how this project allowed me to push myself.
